## Create notes and quick documentation on the fly! 
Scrimbly allows for quick (line) markdown for fast documentation. Do you want a quick cheatsheet, a task list for your current week, or you want to paste some images down? Not a problem!

## Multiple notes
Save as many notes as you like. Filter them out using the searchbar, and rename them if needed. Scrimbly uses a local database to save your notes.

## File export
For backup, and especially during the early development stages of Scrimbly, it's important to be able to import and export. Scrimbly can do it. If you've accidentally deleted a note, you can always rely on any export files you've made.
